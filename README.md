# NLP-NEWS-SUMMERIZATION
This NLP project will use transformer models from Hugging Face to automatically generate news summaries from complete news articles. The transformer models will be fine-tuned on a dataset of news articles and their summaries. This will allow the models to learn to identify the most important information in a news article and generate a summary that captures the main points.

The extractive text summarization method will be used to generate the summaries. This method identifies the most important sentences in the news article and then combines them to form a summary. The sentences are selected based on their relevance to the topic of the article, their importance, and their readability.

This project has the potential to be very useful for busy people who want to stay up-to-date on the news but don't have time to read full articles. The summaries can be generated quickly and easily, and they provide a concise overview of the most important news stories.

Here are some additional details that could be included in the project:

    The news data could be collected from a variety of sources, such as news websites, RSS feeds, and social media.
    The transformer models could be fine-tuned using a variety of techniques, such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning.
    The extractive text summarization method could be improved by using techniques such as sentence scoring, redundancy removal, and readability assessment.
    The project could be extended to include other types of text, such as blog posts, product reviews, and scientific papers.

the key differences between extractive and abstractive text summarization:

    Extractive summarization: This method selects the most important sentences from the original text and combines them to form a summary. The sentences are selected based on their relevance to the topic of the article, their importance, and their readability.
    Abstractive summarization: This method generates a new summary that is different from the original text. The summary is created by paraphrasing the original text, identifying the main ideas, and reconstructing them into a new, concise, and coherent text.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between extractive and abstractive text summarization:

The best approach to use depends on the specific application. Extractive summarization is a good choice for applications where accuracy is important, such as summarizing legal documents or news articles. Abstractive summarization is a good choice for applications where creativity and informativeness are important, such as summarizing product reviews or scientific papers.
